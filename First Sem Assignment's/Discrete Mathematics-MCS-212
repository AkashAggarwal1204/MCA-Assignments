Q2. b) Show that the number is irrational.

Answer. https://d138zd1ktt9iqe.cloudfront.net/media/seo_landing_files/root-11-is-irrational-by-long-division-method-1621338473.png

The value of √11 is 3.31662479036... As we know that a decimal number that is non-terminating and non-repeating is also irrational. The value of root 11 is also non-terminating and non-repeating. This satisfies the condition of √11 being an irrational number.

Q2. c) Using mathematical induction prove that n ! >2! for n >= 4

The result is true for n = 4, since 

4!=2424>42

Let the result be true for n = k, that is

k!>k2

We need to prove that the result is also true for n = k + 1, that is

(k+1)!>(k+1)2

by our assumption

k!>k2

⟹k!(k+1)>k2(k+1)

⟹(k+1)!>k3+k2

⟹(k+1)!>k3+k2+2k+1−2k−1

⟹(k+1)!>(k+1)2+k3−2k−1

⟹(k+1)!>(k+1)2∵k3−2k−1≥55as k≥4

∴The result is true for n= k + 1. Hence by the principle of

mathematical induction , the result is true for all integers≥4
