Question 1. a) What are the desirable characteristics of an algorithm? Find the GCD of p = 144 and q = 55 using Euclid’s algorithm.

Answer. 1)Input specified : 
The input is the data to be transformed during the computation to produce the output.An algorithm should have 0 or 
more well-defined inputs.Input precision requires that you know what kind of data, how much and what form the data should be

2)Output specified : 
The output is the data resulting from the computation (your intended result). An algorithm should have 1 or more well-defined
outputs, and should match the desired output.Output precision also requires that you know what kind of data, how much and what form the output should 
be (or even if there will be any output at all!).

3)Definiteness : 
Algorithms must specify every step and the order the steps must be taken in the process.Definiteness means specifying the sequence of 
operations for turning input into output. Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.Details of each step must be also be spelled out (including how to handle errors).
It should contain everything quantitative and not qualitative.

4)Effectiveness : 
For an algorithm to be effective, it means that all those steps that are required to get to output must be feasible with the available 
resources.It should not contain any unnecessary and redundant steps which could make an algorithm ineffective.

5)Finiteness :
The algorithm must stop, eventually.Stopping may mean that you get the expected output OR you get a response that no solution is possible. Algorithms must terminate
after a finite number of steps.An algorithm should not be infinite and always terminate after definite number of steps. 

There is no point in developing an algorithm which is infinite as it will be useless for us.

6)Independent :
An algorithm should have step-by-step directions, which should be independent of any programming code.It should be such that it could be run on any of the programming languages.
Thus,these are the characteristics that an algorithm should have for its fruitfulness.

--> Find the GCD of p = 144 and q = 55 using Euclid’s algorithm.

GCD of 144 and 55


144 > 55

a = bq + r (0≤r<b)

114  = 55 x 2 + 34
55 = 34 x 1 + 21
34 = 21 x 1 + 13
21 = 13 x 1 + 8
13 = 8 x 1 + 5 
8 = 5 x 1 + 3
5 = 3 x 1 + 2
3 = 2 x 1 + 1
2 = 1 x 1 + 1
1 = 1 x 1 + 0

Here, r = 0
Therefore, Divisor is the GCD
Hence, 1 is the greatest common divisor(GCD) of 144 & 55


--> Find the GCD of p = 144 and q = 55 using Java.

--> First approach

public class GCD {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = 144;
		int b = 55;
		int r;
		do {
			r = a%b;
			a = b;
			b = r;
		} while (r != 0);
		System.out.println(a);
		
		
	}

}

Output = 1


--> Second approach

public class GCD {
	
	 static int gcd(int a, int b)
	    {
	        if (a == 0)
	          return b;
	        if (b == 0)
	          return a;
	      
	        if (a == b)
	            return a;
	        if (a > b)
	            return gcd(a-b, b);
	        return gcd(a, b-a);
	    }
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int p = 114;
		int q = 55;
		System.out.println(gcd(p,q));
	}
	

}

Output = 1
