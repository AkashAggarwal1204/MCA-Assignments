Question 1. What are laws related to equivalence propositions ? Give example for each of equivalence proposition laws.

Answer. Introduction
Two logical expressions are said to be equivalent if they have the same truth value in all cases. Sometimes this fact helps in proving a mathematical result by replacing one expression with another equivalent expression, without changing the truth value of the original compound proposition.

There are three types of propositions when classified according to their truth values
Tautology – A proposition which is always true, is called a tautology.
Contradiction – A proposition which is always false, is called a contradiction.
Contingency – A proposition that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is called a contingency.

1. p V - p  is a tautology.
2. p A \vee q  is a contingency.
3. p V q is a contingency.
