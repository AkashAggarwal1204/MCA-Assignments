Question 1. What are laws related to equivalence propositions ? Give example for each of equivalence proposition laws.

Answer. Introduction
Two logical expressions are said to be equivalent if they have the same truth value in all cases. Sometimes this fact helps in proving a mathematical result by replacing one expression with another equivalent expression, without changing the truth value of the original compound proposition.

There are three types of propositions when classified according to their truth values
Tautology – A proposition which is always true, is called a tautology.
Contradiction – A proposition which is always false, is called a contradiction.
Contingency – A proposition that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is called a contingency.

1. p V - p  is a tautology.
2. p A \vee q  is a contingency.
3. p V q is a contingency.

Definition of Logical Equivalence
Formally,
Two propositions p and q are said to be logically equivalent if p \leftrightarrow q is a Tautology. The notation p\equiv q is used to denote that p and q are logically equivalent.
One way of proving that two propositions are logically equivalent is to use a truth table. The truth table must be identical for all combinations for the given propositions to be equivalent. But this method is not always feasible since the propositions can be increasingly complex both in the number of propositional variables used and size of the expression.
In this case, there needs to be a better way to prove that the two given propositions are logically equivalent. That better way is to construct a mathematical proof which uses already established logical equivalences to construct additional more useful logical equivalences.

Question 1. With respect to rule of precedence, write the truth table for the following expression: p « qÚ~r « r Å q
