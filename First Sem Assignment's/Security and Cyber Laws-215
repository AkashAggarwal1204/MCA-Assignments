Question 1. List and explain any ten security breaches in the Cyberspace. How can these breaches be handled with the use of technology?

Answer. 
1. Microsoft 

In a January 2020 blog post, Microsoft said that an internal customer support database on which the company stored anonymized user analytics had been accidentally exposed online. 
The post was somewhat understated. Over 250 million Microsoft customer records, spanning 14 years, were exposed online without any password protection. The naked database was discovered—and reported to Microsoft—by Bob Diachenko, a security researcher with Security Discovery.
Microsoft blamed the accidental server exposure on misconfigured Azure security rules the company deployed on Dec. 5, 2019. 
Upon learning of the gaffe, Microsoft engineers quickly remediated the configuration to prevent unauthorized access to the database. The company expressed confidence that its commercial cloud services were not exposed.
The 2020 data breach exposed email addresses, IP addresses, and other details stored in a support case analytics database. (Microsoft says that no other personal information was stored in the database.)

2. Estee Lauder

In February, security researcher Jeremiah Fowler came upon a massive online database belonging to cosmetics giant Estee Lauder.  According to Fowler, the unsecured database exposed confidential information stored in over 440 million customer records. 

No payment information or other sensitive data was found to be unprotected, but email addresses, IP addresses, ports, pathways, and storage information was there for the taking, by anyone who wanted it.

A spokesperson for Estée Lauder blamed the 2020 data exposure middleware security failures. That may have provided a way for malware to access applications, data, and systems. Apparently, the database was part of an “education platform” that didn’t contain any consumer data. The company maintains there was no evidence of any unauthorized use of the data.

3. MGM Resorts
Also in February, someone in a hacking forum leaked personal information about more than 10.6 million guests of MGM Resorts hotels.

The leaked contact information for millions of former hotel guests included records of celebrities that included Justin Bieber, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, and a number of government officials. MGM insists that no credit card information or passwords were exposed in the data breach.

Incredibly, this is not the first time confidential information about MGM guests had been openly published online. In mid-2019, MGM employees noticed there had been unauthorized access of a corporate server. That very same day, the stolen information started appearing in a number of hacking forums.

4.Facebook
In April, 2020, around the time COVID-19 protocols were starting to take effect, more than 267 million Facebook profiles popped up for sale on the Dark Web—for the princely sum of $600. 

The pirated profiles were traced back to a data leak discovered in December, but with additional PII (personally identifiable information), including phone numbers and email addresses. 

The leaked information would make it possible for cybercriminals to launch spear-phishing campaigns designed to collect Facebook user passwords through bogus email campaigns or SMS texts disguised as official communications from Facebook.

5. Zoom
In April of 2020, when stay-at-home orders were turning millions into teleworkers, use of video conferencing apps rocketed—with Zoom the primary beneficiary of the increased demand.

As record numbers of workers flocked to Zoom, cyber attackers were able to breach the credentials of over 500,000 Zoom teleconferencing accounts and post them for sale on the dark web for as little as $.02, or simply give the records away on various hacker forums. 

Evidence suggests that hackers canvassed dark web databases for previously compromised login credentials dating back to 2013. The tendency of users to recycle passwords gave the hackers easy access to many new Zoom accounts created by people who saw nothing wrong with reusing their dog’s name spelled backwards for their Zoom password.

Hackers quickly used the compromised passwords to launch credential stuffing attacks that gave them access to even more accounts. The end result? The “zoombombing” of remote workplace meetings by individuals possessing stolen credentials—malcontents who would log into live streaming meetings and create chaos in a variety of ways, including screensharing of disturbing images from pornography and shock videos.

Zoom responded by hiring intelligence firms to locate these password dumps and shut down thousands of websites designed to fool users into downloading malware or ceding their credentials. 

6. Magellan Health
April 2020 saw Healthcare giant Magellan Health fall victim to a phishing scam plus ransomware attack that affected 365,000 patients across eight affiliates and healthcare providers. 

The sophisticated 2020 cyber attack started with a phishing scheme to impersonate clients, a ruse that gave criminals access to a single corporate server on which to deploy malware that yielded sensitive patient details that included W-2 data and Social Security or Taxpayer ID numbers—information that could be ransomed for large sums of money

7. Cognizant 
Also in April, the Maze group launched a ransomware attack on Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS), causing a disruption of services to the company’s clients. 

Confirming the data breach on its website, Cognizant said it had taken steps to contain the incident and notified clients about the attack as well as the measures it was taking to ensure protection. 

In a typical ransomware attack, cybercriminals infect a target company’s systems with a virus and demand payment for returning the data to a usable state. In the case of Cognizant, the Maze attackers demanded payment of a ransom to prevent it from publishing the breached information online.

In June, Cognizant, one of the largest IT managed services enterprises, announced that hackers had stolen customer information in a ransomware attack a few months earlier. The personal information taken in the heist included names, Social Security numbers, tax identification numbers, financial account information, driver’s licenses, and passport information.

8. Nintendo
In April, Nintendo originally reported that 160,000 users were affected by a mass account hijacking that leveraged the company’s NNID legacy login system. The hijacking gave data hackers access to payment services linked to these accounts, including PayPal accounts or credit cards the cybercriminals used to make unsolicited digital purchases. (Reports indicate that these attacks went on for weeks.)

Nintendo responded by shutting down all NNID logins and asking Switch owners to lock down their accounts. 

The gaming giant admitted that the attack may have exposed private information that included nicknames, email addresses, dates of birth and gender. While confirming that purchases were made through user accounts, Nintendo maintains that credit card data itself was not accessed.

Security experts suspect that weak passwords are to blame. Hackers took advantage of vulnerabilities associated with legacy accounts that used Nintendo Network ID (NNID) for older platforms such as Wii U and 3DS.  Designed for setup with the system’s original screen keyboards, NNID made it difficult for users to create strong passwords. (The current system allows users to create account profiles on a web browser.) To prevent additional breaches, Nintendo posted a tweet instructing members to enable 2-step authentication.

9. Twitter  
In July, social media powerhouse Twitter suffered an unprecedented hacking of celebrity accounts as the result of an audacious spear-phishing attack targeting Twitter employees. 130 accounts were hijacked, including the social media platforms of Barack Obama, Kanye West, Elon Musk, Joe Biden and Bill Gates.

Cybercriminals used the hacked accounts to publish a bitcoin scam while also gaining access to these individuals’ direct messages. Reportedly, the scammers netted more than $100,000 from people who had no reason to question why a celebrity would tweet:

“I’m giving back to the community. All bitcoin sent to the address below will be sent back doubled! If you send $1000, I will send back $2000. Only doing this for 30 minutes.”

Bitcoin tweets were published from 45 of the 130 targeted accounts. (The contents of DM messages were accessed on 36 of the accounts and Twitter data was downloaded from seven.) The cyber attack started with calls to Twitter employees by hackers posing as colleagues who needed credentials to internal systems. The trusting employees granted the callers access to the company’s internal support system, enabling the scammers to target additional employees. 

10. Whisper 
This past March, hackers posted the contents of a database containing 900 million Whisper posts, along with metadata related to the anonymous social media posts. In promoting its eponymous “secret-sharing” app, Whisper likes to refer to itself as the “safest place on the Internet”. 

That tagline might need a refresh after cyberthieves exposed all of the PII belonging to Whisper users, including personal confessions, ages, locations and other details—allowing anyone to access all of the content tied to anonymous “whispers” posted to the app.

The exposed records don’t provide any real names but they do include a great deal of demographic information such as the stated age of users, ethnicity, gender, hometown, nickname and any membership in groups, including many devoted to sexual confessions and discussions regarding sexual orientation and desires.

The database was discovered by independent researchers who reported that they were able to access a staggering 900 million user records dating from the original app release in 2012 to the present day. 


Quiestion 2. Explain the following terms with the help of an example: (20 Marks)
(i) Steganography
(ii) Different types of cipher used in cryptography
(iii) RSA algorithm
(iv) Authentication and authorisation
(v) Use of Hash function in security

Answer. 
i). Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data. Steganography can be used to conceal almost any type of digital content, including text, image, video or audio content; the data to be hidden can be hidden inside almost any other type of digital content. The content to be concealed through steganography -- called hidden text -- is often encrypted before being incorporated into the innocuous-seeming cover text file or data stream. If not encrypted, the hidden text is commonly processed in some way in order to increase the difficulty of detecting the secret content.
What are examples for steganography?
Steganography is practiced by those wishing to convey a secret message or code. While there are many legitimate uses for steganography, malware developers have also been found to use steganography to obscure the transmission of malicious code.

Forms of steganography have been used for centuries and include almost any technique for hiding a secret message in an otherwise harmless container. For example, using invisible ink to hide secret messages in otherwise inoffensive messages; hiding documents recorded on microdot -- which can be as small as 1 millimeter in diameter -- on or inside legitimate-seeming correspondence; and even by using multiplayer gaming environments to share information.

ii). 
Substitution ciphers. Replace bits, characters, or character blocks in plaintext with alternate bits, characters or character blocks to produce ciphertext. ...
Transposition ciphers. ...
Polygraphic ciphers. ...
Permutation ciphers. ...
Private-key cryptography. ...
Public-key cryptography.

iii). 
RSA algorithm is asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that it works on two different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes that the Public Key is given to everyone and Private key is kept private.

An example of asymmetric cryptography :

A client (for example browser) sends its public key to the server and requests for some data.
The server encrypts the data using client’s public key and sends the encrypted data.
Client receives this data and decrypts it.

The idea! The idea of RSA is based on the fact that it is difficult to factorize a large integer. The public key consists of two numbers where one number is multiplication of two large prime numbers. And private key is also derived from the same two prime numbers. So if somebody can factorize the large number, the private key is compromised. Therefore encryption strength totally lies on the key size and if we double or triple the key size, the strength of encryption increases exponentially. RSA keys can be typically 1024 or 2048 bits long, but experts believe that 1024 bit keys could be broken in the near future. But till now it seems to be an infeasible task.

Select two prime no's. Suppose P = 53 and Q = 59.
Now First part of the Public key  : n = P*Q = 3127.
 We also need a small exponent say e : 
But e Must be 

An integer.
Not be a factor of n. 
1 < e < Φ(n) [Φ(n) is discussed below], 
Let us now consider it to be equal to 3.

    
Our Public Key is made of n and e

iv). 

Authentication	                                                                                                                                    Authorization
Determines whether users are who they claim to be	                                                                                    Determines what users can and cannot access
Challenges the user to validate credentials (for example, through passwords, answers to security questions, or facial recognition)	   Verifies whether access is allowed through policies and rules
Usually done before authorization	                                                                                                      Usually done after successful authentication
Generally, transmits info through an ID Token                                                                                          	Generally, transmits info through an Access Token
Generally governed by the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol	                                                                              Generally governed by the OAuth 2.0 framework
Example: Employees in a company are required to authenticate through the network before accessing their company email	                   Example: After an employee successfully authenticates, the system determines what information the employees are allowed to access

v). 
Hash Function is a function that has a huge role in making a System Secure as it converts normal data given to it as an irregular value of fixed length. We can imagine it to be a Shaker in our homes. 
When we put data into this function it outputs an irregular value. The Irregular value it outputs is known as “Hash Value”.Hash Values are simply numbers but are often written in Hexadecimal. Computers manage values as Binary. The hash value is also data and is often managed in Binary. A hash function is basically performing some calculations in the computer. Data values that are its output are of fixed length. Length always varies according to the hash function. Value doesn’t vary even if there is a large or small value.  If given the same input, two hash functions will invariably produce the same output. Even if input data entered differs by a single bit, huge change in their output values. Even if input data entered differs huge, there is a very very minimal chance that the hash values produced will be identical. If they are equal it is known as “Hash Collision”.  Converting Hash Codes to their original value is an impossible task to perform. This is the main difference between Encryption as Hash Function.  


Question 3. Explain the security measures and security policies of an online systems. 

Answer. The single biggest thing you can do to protect a computer system from online threats is… don’t put it online. There’s a reason that “air-gapped” systems are often used for highly confidential information - if the bad guys can’t reach it, they can’t hack it.

Otherwise, you want to minimize the “attack surface” of the system. All of the usual protections apply here - don’t run any unnecessary ports or services, put a firewall up between the system and the big bad Internet, make sure all software (and firmware) is up-to-date, and configure the system so the users (or unauthorized processes) can’t install extra software.
Security policies are written guidelines related to security- from physical to information. The procedures are the things done to ensure policies are followed and controls implemented to support the policies.

Question 4. Why is Cyberlaws needed? How can cyberspace be regulated? Explain the cyberspace regulation in India.

Answer. Cyber Laws In India
In India, cyber laws are contained in the Information Technology Act, 2000 (“IT Act”) which came into force on October 17, 2000. The main purpose of the Act is to provide legal recognition to electronic commerce and to facilitate filing of electronic records with the Government.

The existing laws of India, even with the most compassionate and liberal interpretation could not be interpreted in the light of the emergency cyberspace, to include all aspects relating to different activities in cyberspace. In fact, the practical experience and the wisdom of judgement found that it shall not be without major threats and pitfalls, if the existing laws were to be interpreted in the scenario of emerging cyberspace, without enacting new cyber laws. Hence, the need for enactment of relevant cyber laws.

None of the existing laws gave any legal validity or sanction to the activities in Cyberspace. For example, the Net is used by a large majority of users for email. Yet till today, email id not “legal” in our country. There is no law in the country, which gives legal validity, and sanction to email. Courts and judiciary in our country have been reluctant to grant judicial recognition to the legality of email in the absence of any specific law having been enacted by the Parliament. As such the need has arisen for Cyber law.

Importance of Cyber Laws
# We are living in highly digitalized world.
# All companies depend upon their computer networks and keep their valuable data in electronic form.
# Government forms including income tax returns, company law forms etc are now filled in electronic form.
# Consumers are increasingly using credit cards for shopping.
# Most people are using email, cell phones and SMS messages for communication.
# Even in “non-cyber crime” cases, important evidence is found in computers/ cell phones e.g. in cases of divorce, murder, kidnapping, organized crime, terrorist operations, counterfeit currency etc.
# Since it touches all the aspects of transactions and activities on and concerning the Internet, the World Wide Web and Cyberspace therefore Cyber law is extremely important.[4]

Categories of Cyber Crime
1. Cybercrimes against persons
2. Cybercrimes against property
3. Cybercrimes against government
1. Against a Person
# Cyber stalking
# Impersonation
# Loss of Privacy
# Transmission of Obscene Material
# Harassment with the use of computer

2. Against Property
# Unauthorized Computer Trespassing
# Computer vandalism
# Transmission of harmful programmes
# Siphoning of funds from financial institutions

Question 5. : Explain the following with the help of suitable examples (20 Marks)
(i) Cybercrimes and its classification
(ii) Penalties and Compensation against cyber crimes
(iii)Cyber forensic
(iv)Cybercrime investigation


Answer. 

1. Against Individuals: These include e-mail spoofing, spamming, cyber defamation, cyber harassments and cyber stalking. 2. Against Property: These include credit card frauds, internet time theft and intellectual property crimes. 3. Against Organisations: These include unauthorized accessing of computer, denial Of service, computer contamination / virus attack, e-mail bombing, salami attack, logic bomb, trojan horse and data diddling. 4. Against Society: These include Forgery, CYber Terrorism, Web Jacking. Classification Of Cyber Crimes Cyber crimes can be classified in to 4 major categories as the following:

(1) Cyber crime against Individual       (2) Cyber crime Against Property (3) Cyber crime Against Organization  (4) Cyber crime Against Society  

(1) Against Individuals (i) Email spoofing : A spoofed email is one in which the e-mail header is forged so that the mail appears to originate from one source but actually has been sent from another source. (ii) Spamming : Spamming means sending multiple copies of unsolicited mails or mass e-mails such as chain letters. (iii) Cyber Defamation : This occurs when defamation takes place with the help of computers and/or the Internet. E.g. someone publishes defamatory matter about someone on a website or sends e-mails containing defamatory information. (iv) Harassment & Cyber stalking : Cyber Stalking Means following an individual's activity over internet. It can be done with the help of many protocols available such as e- mail, chat rooms, user net groups.   (2) Against Property (i) Credit Card Fraud : As the name suggests, this is a fraud that happens by the use of a credit card. This generally happens if someone gets to know the card number or the card gets stolen. (ii) Intellectual Property crimes : These include Software piracy: Illegal copying of programs, distribution of copies of software. Copyright infringement: Using copyrighted material without proper permission. Trademarks violations: Using trademarks and associated rights without permission of the actual holder. Theft of computer source code: Stealing, destroying or misusing the source code of a computer. (iii) Internet time theft : This happens by the usage of the Internet hours by an unauthorized person which is actually paid by another person.

(3) Against Organisations (i) Unauthorized Accessing of Computer: Accessing the computer/network without permission from the owner. It can be of 2 forms: a) Changing/deleting data: Unauthorized changing of data. b) Computer voyeur: The criminal reads or copies confidential or proprietary information, but the data is neither deleted nor changed. (ii) Denial Of Service : When Internet server is flooded with continuous bogus requests so as to denying legitimate users to use the server or to crash the server. (iii) Computer contamination / Virus attack : A computer virus is a computer program that can infect other computer programs by modifying them in such a way as to include a (possibly evolved) copy of it. Viruses can be file infecting or affecting boot sector of the computer. Worms, unlike viruses do not need the host to attach themselves to. (iv) Email Bombing : Sending large numbers of mails to the individual or company or mail servers thereby ultimately resulting into crashing. (v) Salami Attack : When negligible amounts are removed & accumulated in to something larger. These attacks are used for the commission of financial crimes. (vi) Logic Bomb : It is an event dependent program. As soon as the designated event occurs, it crashes the computer, release a virus or any other harmful possibilities. (vii) Trojan Horse : This is an unauthorized program which functions from inside what seems to be an authorized program, thereby concealing what it is actually doing. (viii) Data diddling : This kind of an attack involves altering raw data just before it is processed by a computer and then changing it back after the processing is completed.   (4) Against Society (i) Forgery : Currency notes, revenue stamps, mark sheets etc. can be forged using computers and high quality scanners and printers. (ii) Cyber Terrorism : Use of computer resources to intimidate or coerce people and carry out the activities of terrorism. (iii) Web Jacking : Hackers gain access and control over the website of another, even they change the content of website for fulfilling political objective or for money.

Introduction:-

Like every other invention in history, the internet came with its advantages and disadvantages. Little did the founding fathers know that their creation will be used someday to harm and destroy someone. Today, various dangerous things are happening in cyberspace. Using the web with criminal intent is known as cybercrime. 
The term “cybercrime” is not defined under any statute in India. But in the wider sense, it could mean, any activity done with criminal intent in cyberspace, where the computer could be a tool as well as the victim. Sometimes, these crimes are committed for generating profits, sometimes it is done to damage software and at other times it is done to ship malware into a system that enters other machines and spreads to the whole network in no time. Cybercrime could involve traditional criminal activities like theft, fraud, mischief, forgery, or defamation which are subject to the Indian Penal Code, 1860; and the new age crimes are subject to the Information Technology Act, 2000. 

Cybercrimes can be divided into two categories broadly;
1.Where the computer is used as a weapon. Such crimes are- cyber terrorism, credit card fraud, IPR violations, pornography
2.Where the computer is the target. Such crimes include the use of one computer to damage another one like launching virus, hacking, DOS attacks

There are various types of cybercrimes which are divided into mainly 3 headings based on their target-
1.Cybercrimes against person such as pornography, defamation, harassment via mail, email bombing, cyberstalking, cyber extortion, etc. These are the most important cybercrimes known today and are capable of causing potential harm to humanity. 
2.Cybercrimes against property such as cyber vandalism, data theft, transmitting the virus, unauthorized computer trespassing, IPR infringement, credit card frauds, etc
3.Cybercrimes against the government are like cyber terrorism. Cyberspace is misused by individuals and certain groups to threaten international governments and their citizens by cracking the official governmental or military websites.

Significant Cyber Crimes:-

Cyber extortion- This crime involves an attack or a threat to attack to demand extortion money. One such type is a ransomware attack. Cybercriminals hack into the network of an organization and make any potential data or documents inaccessible until a ransom is paid. 
Identity theft- This crime constitutes an attack where an individual trespasses into a computer to extract the personal information of the user like banking details, credit card number, identity card number, personal health details, etc. Such information is bought and sold on the dark web for profits and is often used to commit frauds and making unauthorized transactions. 

Cyber espionage- Under this crime, individuals or groups hacks into the system and gather confidential information from the government or any organization. It constitutes every type of attack from destroying the data to modifying it or using system-connected devices like a webcam to spy on an individual or monitoring the email, messages, and other connections.

Software piracy- This is one of the most common cybercrimes today which involves unauthorized use, unlawful copying, or distribution of such copy. This is often done for personal or commercial gain. IPR infringement, counterfeiting, internet piracy are some of its examples.

Exit scam- The digital version of this old scam involves the transfer of virtual currency held in marketplace escrow accounts to the accounts of dark web administrators. 

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks- This type of attack is performed by using the organization’s protocol and taking advantage of its limits to shut down the server by overwhelming its capacity to respond to communications. These attacks are generally carried out for malicious purposes or committing mischief and sometimes to divert the attention of the targeted network from another attack.

Phishing attacks- This is the technique for acquiring sensitive information like login details, passwords, credit card details, company data, etc. of a user by sending fraudulent messages (mostly emails) that appear to be coming from a trustworthy and reputable source.  

Cyber Laws in India:-

“Every action and reaction occurring in the cyberspace has some legal and cyber legal perspectives”. The term “cyberlaw” is used to address the legal issues occurring in cyberspace. It is an integration of various laws to deal with and resolve such issues and challenges posed by humanity on the web every day.
As cybercrime is a field still developing towards specialization, there is absolutely no comprehensive law to deal with it, anywhere in the world till date. But Government of India has the Information Technology Act, 2000 in force to regulate the malicious activities on the web that violate the rights of an internet user. At times, one may find that there are provisions of the IPC and IT Act that penalize such activities overlap each other. 

Penalties under Cyber Crimes:-

Section 43 and 66 of the IT Act punishes a person committing data theft, transmitting virus into a system, hacking, destroying data, or denying access to the network to an authorized person with maximum imprisonment up to 3 years or a fine of rupees 5 lacs or both. At the same time data theft is also punishable under Section 378 and Section 424 of IPC with maximum imprisonment of 3 years or fine or both; and imprisonment of 2 years or fine or both respectively. Denying access to an authorized person or damaging a computer system is penalized under Section 426 of IPC with imprisonment of up to 3 months or fine or both.

Tampering with computer source documents is a punishable offence under Section 65 of the IT Act. Section 66E provides the punishment for violation of privacy. It states that if any person captures, publishes, or distributes an image of a private area of a person without his/her consent has committed a breach of privacy and is punishable with imprisonment up to 3 years or a fine up to 2 lacs or both.

Section 66F covers a crucial matter which is cyber terrorism and prescribes punishment for the same. It provides the acts which constitute cyber terrorism like denial of access or penetrating through a network or transmitting virus/malware utilizing which he is likely to cause death or injury to any person, which is all done with the purpose to threat the integrity, sovereignty, unity, and security of India or create terror in the minds of its citizen.

Section 66B of the IT Act and Section 411 of IPC deal with the offense of dishonestly receiving stolen computer resources or devices. Section 66C of the IT Act prescribes punishment for identity theft and states that any person who uses the identity credentials of a person for fraud or in a dishonest manner is liable for punishment with imprisonment up to 3 years and a fine up to Rupees 3 lacs. Cheating by personation using a computer resource is punishable under Section 66D of the IT Act. Similar provisions for these offenses are given under IPC under Section 419, 463, 465, and 468. IT Act not only punishes persons but corporate as well if they fail to implement and maintain a reasonable and diligent mechanism to protect the sensitive data of any person in their possession. Such a body corporate is liable to pay compensation to the aggrieved person who has suffered a loss due to the negligence of the corporation.

Apart from the provisions for punishment, the IT Act also empowers the Central Government to issue directions to block access of any information on an intermediary or computer resource for the public, if it feels necessary in the interest of the State. It can also intercept, decrypt or monitor such information.

iii). 
Cyber forensics is a process of extracting data as proof for a crime (that involves electronic devices) while following proper investigation rules to nab the culprit by presenting the evidence to the court. Cyber forensics is also known as computer forensics. The main aim of cyber forensics is to maintain the thread of evidence and documentation to find out who did the crime digitally. Cyber forensics can do the following:

It can recover deleted files, chat logs, emails, etc
It can also get deleted SMS, Phone calls.
It can get recorded audio of phone conversations.
It can determine which user used which system and for how much time.
It can identify which user ran which program.

Why is cyber forensics important?
in todays technology driven generation, the importance of cyber forensics is immense. Technology combined with forensic forensics paves the way for quicker investigations and accurate results. Below are the points depicting the importance of cyber forensics:

Cyber forensics helps in collecting important digital evidence to trace the criminal.
Electronic equipment stores massive amounts of data that a normal person fails to see. For example: in a smart house, for every word we speak, actions performed by smart devices, collect huge data which is crucial in cyber forensics.
It is also helpful for innocent people to prove their innocence via the evidence collected online.
It is not only used to solve digital crimes but also used to solve real-world crimes like theft cases, murder, etc.
Businesses are equally benefitted from cyber forensics in tracking system breaches and finding the attackers.

How did Cyber Forensics Experts work?
Cyber forensics is a field that follows certain procedures to find the evidence to reach conclusions after proper investigation of matters. The procedures that cyber forensic experts follow are:

Identification: The first step of cyber forensics experts are to identify what evidence is present, where it is stored, and in which format it is stored.
Preservation: After identifying the data the next step is to safely preserve the data and not allow other people to use that device so that no one can tamper data.
Analysis: After getting the data, the next step is to analyze the data or system. Here the expert recovers the deleted files and verifies the recovered data and finds the evidence that the criminal tried to erase by deleting secret files. This process might take several iterations to reach the final conclusion.
Documentation: Now after analyzing data a record is created. This record contains all the recovered and available(not deleted) data which helps in recreating the crime scene and reviewing it.
Presentation: This is the final step in which the analyzed data is presented in front of the court to solve cases.
Types of computer forensics
There are multiple types of computer forensics depending on the field in which digital investigation is needed. The fields are:

Network forensics: This involves monitoring and analyzing the network traffic to and from the criminal’s network. The tools used here are network intrusion detection systems and other automated tools.
Email forensics: In this type of forensics, the experts check the email of the criminal and recover deleted email threads to extract out crucial information related to the case.
Malware forensics: This branch of forensics involves hacking related crimes. Here, the forensics expert examines the malware, trojans to identify the hacker involved behind this.
